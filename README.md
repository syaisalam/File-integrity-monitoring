<h1>FIM - File Integrity Monitoring</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to showcase one of the pillars of security from the CIA triad; the property of integrity. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and consistency of data. This means that the original data is unchanged and if it does get change it will produce an alert to warn that its integrity is compromised. To showcase this, a simple FIM is produced which is basically an application that monitors important files, validating its integrity by using a verification method between the current state and a known baseline. FIM is referenced as one of a security control in frameworks and compliance documentations such as the PCI DSS (ID: W-06).
